## Horiseon Webpage Code Optimization

This webpage is a home page for Horiseon that is optimized for search engines and that follows accessibility standards for its codebase. The goal was to take the existing code and take my knowledge from class and optimize the codebase. I believe I have created a more streamlined version of the CSS and HTML code along with learning a few new semantics for both CSS and HTML.

## Usage

To use this webpage click on each of the link in the top right corner of the webpage. "Search Engine Optimazation, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing" will each direct you farther down the webpage to descriptions of each term. To the right of this section you will see a side section talking about the benefits of using the site. In the code you will see updated semantics as well as condensed CSS flow to better direct and guide users through the code.
